## Description

This project is the first Capstone Project in Udemy's "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" instructed by Dr. Angela Yu.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to brush up on old skills and become familiar with HTML and multi-paged websites after a long hiatus. No focus on CSS (except for some minor editing to make it look a tad bit more presentable), just bare HTML for practice.

## Project Instructions

1.  Create an HTML file named "index.html"
2.  Use the !DOCTYPE html declaration
3.  Create a head section with a title element of "My Resume"
4.  Inside the body, write HTML code to create a resume with relevant information
5.  Utilize appropriate / relevant HTML tags
6.  Include a self-portrait
7.  Add project to Github
